Assalamu alaikum
Today i have completed my currency convert project.

At first i have completed HTML Aand css part. After that i have done JavaScript part. 

Now I am going to talk about my javascript part. In JavaScript i have called four function. 
Two for select tag and two for input element. 

Inside the select element i seted two javascript change event 
like this : 
currencyOneElm.addEventListener('change',calculate)
currencyTwoElm.addEventListener('change',calculate)

and inside the input event i seted two javascript input event 
like this : 
amoutOneElm.addEventListener('input',calculate)
amoutTwoElm.addEventListener('input',calculate)

Inside all the eventListener i have called calculate funciton that i already call as a main funciton.

In the main calculate functions i have resived inputs value and select elements value. Then i requested an API server. After that i resive currency data form api. Inside the fetch conversion_rates and then i calculate it with input elemetn 1. In this way i have completed my simple currency convert project.
